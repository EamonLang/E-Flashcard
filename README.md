# E-Flashcard
Full stack Flashcard website using Flask, MYSQL, HTML, CSS, and vanilla javascript.

This aplication was created in response to alternative flashcard website, Quizlet, was banned at my school. In response I remade my own version using Flask, Vanilla JS, CSS, MySQL, and HTML. This is my first attempt at a website and I deployed using the service Railway. 

This was my fourth version of this app. The first three were native tkinter apps that I made on my computer. They were completely written in python. The most recent version of tkinter has a chat bot designed to have conversations in spanish allowing users to have native like conversations. You can find the old versions of my code on my github. I moved my project from tkinter to a website because I really wanted to learn web development and Java script more specfifically. Aditionally I learned the basics of Flask aswell as encryption and managing user states.

Recently I have began working on an AI that creates flashcards based off of a user input and I hope to be able to implement this idea soon. 

If you have any questions or feedback. On my website there is a feedback box. You just have to create an account.

Eamon,
